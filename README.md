# lovecraft_tf_idf
Extract most common words from the works of H P Lovecraft.

This is a quick and dirty script to use tf_idf on the entire corpus of H P Lovecraft stories, available free online since it is in the public domain.  The purpose was to generate a list of words for a collaborative storytelling game in which words are burned with a laser engraver onto 2.5 cm wood cubes to be rolled as dice.
